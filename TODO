* safety checks
	* argument consistency
	* values in bounds
	* missing values
	* etc.

* persistence
	options:
	* RawVector as memory backend (???)
		- difficult
		* decode on reload
		* how to detect reload
	* R frontend that keeps a copy of the structure
		- potentially quite slow
		* how to detect reload?
		- duplicate effort
		- risk of async between R and C++ code
		+ doable
	* ignore
		* avoid crash on session reload!!!
		- unexpected behaviour
		+ everybody seems to do it

* plotting
	* which packages to support?
	* which should be default?

* data formats for import/export
	* important formats to support?

* documentation
	* package docs!
	* examples
	* example data (?)

* real node/edge ids (i.e. strings, R objects, etc.)

* node/edge metadata (???)

* individual-based simulations
	-> lib

* lineage-based approximation
	-> lib
