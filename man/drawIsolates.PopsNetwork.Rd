\usage{
\method{drawIsolates}{PopsNetwork}(pNet, samples)
}
\arguments{
\item{pNet}{a PopsNet object.}

\item{samples}{Number of samples to draw from each node. This has to be a dataframe
with node ids in $nodes and number of isolates to draw in $N.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with node id in $node and number of isolates with allele \code{x}
in $\code{allele_x}.
}
\description{
Draw a set of isolates from the network.
}
\details{
Draw a random set of isolates from a number of nodes in the network. This will
*only* work if allele frequencies have been set or simulated.
