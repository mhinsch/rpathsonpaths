\usage{
set_allele_freqs(p_net, ini_dist)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_net}{A popsnetwork object.}

\item{ini_dist}{Initial distribution of allele frequencies. ini_dist has to be 
a list
containing a vector of node IDs (@seealso \code{\link{popsnetwork}}) as $nodes and
a matrix of allele frequencies as $frequencies. Note that *any* node pre-set in this
way will be treated as a source only by spread_dirichlet.}
}
\value{
A new popsnetwork object.
}
\description{
Pre-set allele frequencies for some nodes.
}
\details{
Use this function to initialize allele frequencies for some nodes of the network.
